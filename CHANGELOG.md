### Added

### Changed
- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file — the
logging of changes.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the

notable changes.

  standardized open source project CHANGELOG.

- README now contains answers to common questions about CHANGELOGs

- Counter-examples: "What makes unicorns cry?"
