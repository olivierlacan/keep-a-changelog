### Added
- RU translation from @aishek.
- pt-BR translation from @tallesl.

## [0.2.0] - 2015-10-06

both "open" and "closed" source projects equally.

### Added
- Answer "Should you ever rewrite a change log?".

### Changed
- Improve argument against commit logs.

## [0.0.8] - 2015-02-17

  writes dates in a strange way.

## [0.0.5] - 2014-08-09

- Markdown links to version tags on release headings.

keeping prior to releases.

## [0.0.4] - 2014-08-09
### Added
- Better explanation of the difference between the file ("CHANGELOG")
and its function "the change log".

### Changed
- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file — the
logging of changes.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.

### Added
- "Why should I care?" section mentioning The Changelog podcast.

### Added
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a standardized open source project CHANGELOG.
- CNAME file to enable GitHub Pages custom domain
- README now contains answers to common questions about CHANGELOGs
- Good examples and basic guidelines, including proper date formatting.
- Counter-examples: "What makes unicorns cry?"
