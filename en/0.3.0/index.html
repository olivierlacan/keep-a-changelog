(Example: <code>2012-06-02</code> for <code>June 2nd, 2012</code>.)

Calm down. I know you&#39;re furiously rushing to find that link to the GNU change log style guide, or the two-paragraph GNU NEWS file &quot;guideline&quot;. The GNU style guide is a nice start but it is sadly naive. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being naive but when people need guidance it&#39;s rarely very helpful. Especially when there are many situations and edge cases to deal with.</p> <p>This project <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become a better CHANGELOG file convention</a>. I don&#39;t think the status quo is good enough, and I think that as a community we can come up with better conventions if we try to extract good practices from real software projects. Please take a look around and remember that <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues">discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcome</a>!</p> <h3 id='what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named'><a id='what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named' class='anchor' href='#what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named' aria-hidden='true'></a>What should the change log file be named?</h3> <p>Well, if you can’t tell from the example above, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is the best convention so far.</p> <p>Some projects also use <code>HISTORY.txt</code>, <code>HISTORY.md</code>, <code>History.md</code>, <code>NEWS.txt</code>, <code>NEWS.md</code>, <code>News.txt</code>, <code>RELEASES.txt</code>, <code>RELEASE.md</code>, <code>releases.md</code>, etc.</p> <p>It’s a mess. All these names only makes it harder for people to find it.</p> <h3 id='why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff'><a id='why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff' class='anchor' href='#why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff' aria-hidden='true'></a>Why can’t people just use a <code>git log</code> diff?</h3> <p>Because log diffs are full of noise — by nature. They could not make a suitable change log even in a hypothetical project run by perfect humans who never make typos, never forget to commit new files, never miss any part of a refactoring. The purpose of a commit is to document one atomic step in the process by which the code evolves from one state to another. The purpose of a change log is to document the noteworthy differences between these states.</p> <p>As is the difference between good comments and the code itself, so is the difference between a change log and the commit log: one describes the <em>why</em>, the other the how.</p> <h3 id='can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed'><a id='can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed' class='anchor' href='#can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed' aria-hidden='true'></a>Can change logs be automatically parsed?</h3> <p>It’s difficult, because people follow wildly different formats and file names.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/">Vandamme</a> is a Ruby gem created by the <a href="https://gemnasium.com/">Gemnasium</a> team and which parses many (but not all) open source project change logs.</p> <h3 id='why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot'><a id='why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot' class='anchor' href='#why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot' aria-hidden='true'></a>Why do you alternate between spelling it &quot;CHANGELOG&quot; and &quot;change log&quot;?</h3> <p>&quot;CHANGELOG&quot; is the name of the file itself. It&#39;s a bit shouty but it&#39;s a historical convention followed by many open source projects. Other examples of similar files include <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p> <p>The uppercase naming (which in old operating systems made these files stick to the top) is used to draw attention to them. Since they&#39;re important metadata about the project, they could be useful to anyone intending to use or contribute to it, much like <a href="http://shields.io/">open source project badges</a>.</p> <p>When I refer to a &quot;change log&quot;, I&#39;m talking about the function of this file: to log changes.</p> <h3 id='what-about-yanked-releases'><a id='what-about-yanked-releases' class='anchor' href='#what-about-yanked-releases' aria-hidden='true'></a>What about yanked releases?</h3> <p>Yanked releases are versions that had to be pulled because of a serious bug or security issue. Often these versions don&#39;t even appear in change logs. They should. This is how you should display them:</p> <p><code>## 0.0.5 - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]</code></p> <p>The <code>[YANKED]</code> tag is loud for a reason. It&#39;s important for people to notice it. Since it&#39;s surrounded by brackets it&#39;s also easier to parse programmatically.</p> <h3 id='should-you-ever-rewrite-a-change-log'><a id='should-you-ever-rewrite-a-change-log' class='anchor' href='#should-you-ever-rewrite-a-change-log' aria-hidden='true'></a>Should you ever rewrite a change log?</h3> <p>Sure. There are always good reasons to improve a change log. I regularly open pull requests to add missing releases to open source projects with unmaintained change logs.</p> <p>It&#39;s also possible you may discover that you forgot to address a breaking change in the notes for a version. It&#39;s obviously important for you to update your change log in this case.</p> <h3 id='how-can-i-contribute'><a id='how-can-i-contribute' class='anchor' href='#how-can-i-contribute' aria-hidden='true'></a>How can I contribute?</h3> <p>This document is not the <strong>truth</strong>; it’s my carefully considered opinion, along with information and examples I gathered.
