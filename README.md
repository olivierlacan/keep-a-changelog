Don’t let your friends dump git logs into changelogs™

This repository generates https://keepachangelog.com/.

## Development

### Dependencies

- Ruby ([see version][ruby-version], [rbenv][rbenv] recommended)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

### Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog.git`
- `cd keep-a-changelog`
- `bundle install`
- `bin/rake serve` starts a local development server at http://localhost:4567
  which will reload with any local file changes
- `bin/rake build` runs middleman build with `--verbose` flag so build errors are 
  logged for easier debugging

### Deployment

- `bin/rake clean` can clean a corrupted `build/` directory in 
  case `publish` failed
- `bin/rake publish` builds and pushes to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub so 
  the site is deployed to keepachangelog.com

### Translations

Create a new directory in [`source/`][source] named after the ISO 639-1 code
for the language you wish to translate Keep a Changelog to. For example,
assuming you want to translate to French Canadian:

- create the `source/fr-CA` directory.
- duplicate the `source/en/1.0.0/index.html.haml` file in `source/fr-CA`.
- edit `source/fr-CA/1.0.0/index.html.haml` until your translation is ready.
- commit your changes to your own [fork][fork]
- submit a [Pull Request][pull-request] with your changes

It may take some time to review your submitted Pull Request. Try to involve a
few native speakers of the language you're translating to in the Pull Request
comments. They'll help review your translation for simple mistakes and give us
a better idea of whether your translation is accurate.
