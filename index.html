<h1>Keep a CHANGELOG</h1>
<h2>Don’t let your friends dump git logs into CHANGELOGs™</h2>
<h3>What’s a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>A CHANGELOG is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered
list of notable changes for each version of an open source project.</p>
<p><a href="./CHANGELOG.md"><img src="assets/images/changelog_example_distorted.png" alt="Changelog Example"></a></p>
<h3>What’s the point of a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what
notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.</p>
<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Because software tools are for people. If you don’t care, why are
you contributing to open source? Surely, there must be a kernel (ha!) 
of care somewhere in that lovely little brain of yours.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://5by5.tv/changelog/127">talked with Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo on The Changelog</a>
(fitting, right?) podcast about why open source maintainers and
contributors should care, and the motivations behind this project. 
If you can spare the time (1:06), it’s a good listen.</p>
<h3>What makes a good CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>I’m glad you asked. </p>
<p>A good CHANGELOG sticks to these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.</li>
<li>Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).</li>
<li>One sub-section per version.</li>
<li>List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).</li>
<li>Write all dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. (Example: <code>2012-06-02</code> for <code>June 2nd, 2012</code>.) It’s international, sensible, and language-independent.</li>
<li>Explicitly mention whether the project follows <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>.</li>
<li>Each version should:
<ul>
<li>List its release date in the above format.</li>
<li>Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:</li>
<li><code>Added</code> for new features.</li>
<li><code>Deprecated</code> for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.</li>
<li><code>Removed</code> for deprecated features removed in this release.</li>
<li><code>Fixed</code> for any bug fixes.</li>
<li><code>Security</code> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I minimize the effort required?</h3>
<p>Always have an <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> section at the top for keeping track of any
changes.</p>
<p>This serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases</li>
<li>At release time, you just have to change <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> to the version number
and add a new <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> header at the top.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What makes unicorns cry?</h3>
<p>Alright…let’s get into it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dumping a diff of commit logs.</strong> Just don’t do that, you’re helping nobody.</li>
<li><strong>Not emphasizing deprecations.</strong> When people upgrade from one version to
another, it should be painfully clear when something will break.</li>
<li><strong>Dates in region-specific formats.</strong> Americans put the month first
(&quot;06-02-2012&quot; for June 2nd, 2012, which makes <em>no</em> sense), while Brits
use a robotic-looking &quot;2 June 2012&quot;, yet pronounce it &quot;June 2nd, 2012&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more. Help me collect those unicorn tears by
<a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues/new">opening an issue</a>
or a pull request.</p>
<h3>Is there a standard CHANGELOG format?</h3>
<p>Sadly, no. But I want to change that. </p>
<p>This project <a href="./CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become the standard CHANGELOG file</a>
for all open source projects. Take a look at it, and please suggest improvements!</p>
<h3>What should the CHANGELOG file be named?</h3>
<p>Well, if you can’t tell from the example above, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is the
best convention so far.</p>
<p>Some projects also use <code>HISTORY.txt</code>, <code>HISTORY.md</code>, <code>History.md</code>, <code>NEWS.txt</code>,
<code>NEWS.md</code>, <code>News.txt</code>, <code>RELEASES.txt</code>, <code>RELEASE.md</code>, <code>releases.md</code>, etc.</p>
<p>It’s a mess. All these names only makes it harder for people to find it.</p>
<h3>Why can’t people just use a <code>git log</code> diff?</h3>
<p>Because log diffs are full of noise. Can we really expect every single
commit in an open source project to be meaningful and self-explanatory?
That seems like a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Can CHANGELOG files be automatically parsed?</h3>
<p>It’s difficult, because people follow wildly different formats and file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/">Vandamme</a> is a Ruby gem
created by the <a href="http://gemnasium.com">Gemnasium</a> team and which parses
many (but not all) open source project CHANGELOGs.</p>
<h3>Why do you keep writing CHANGELOG in all caps?</h3>
<p>You’re right, that is a bit shouty. Maybe it’s because of the <em>de facto</em>
convention: files pertaining to an open source project should be in
all caps. For instance: <a href="README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>,
<a href="CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p>
<p>This indicates that these files are metadata for the project. Much like
<a href="http://shields.io">open source project badges</a>, they draw attention to
themselves as information to be aware of if someone intends to use
the project or contribute to it.</p>
<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
<p>This document is not the <strong>truth</strong>; it’s my carefully considered
opinion, along with information and examples I gathered. 
Although I provide an actual <a href="./CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> on <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog">the GitHub repo</a>,
I have purposefully not created a proper <em>release</em> or clear list of rules
to follow (as <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer.org</a> does, for instance). </p>
<p>This is because I want our community to reach a consensus. I believe the 
discussion is as important as the end result. </p>
<p>So please <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues"><strong>pitch in</strong></a>.</p>
