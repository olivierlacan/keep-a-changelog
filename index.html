<a name="what-s-a-change-log-" class="anchor" href="#what-s-a-change-log-"></a>
What’s a change log?
</h3>
<p>A change log is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered
list of notable changes for each version of an open source project.</p>
<p><a href="CHANGELOG.md" title="An example of a CHANGELOG file."><iframe src="CHANGELOG.md" width="570" height="350" seamless="seamless" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 1em; margin: 0 0.5em;"></iframe></a></p>
<h3 id="what-s-the-point-of-a-change-log-">
<a name="what-s-the-point-of-a-change-log-" class="anchor" href="#what-s-the-point-of-a-change-log-"></a>
What’s the point of a change log?
</h3>
<p>To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what
notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-care-">
<a name="why-should-i-care-" class="anchor" href="#why-should-i-care-"></a>
Why should I care?
</h3>
<p>Because software tools are for people. If you don’t care, why are
you contributing to open source? Surely, there must be a kernel (ha!)
of care somewhere in that lovely little brain of yours.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://5by5.tv/changelog/127">talked with Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo on The Changelog</a>
(fitting, right?) podcast about why open source maintainers and
contributors should care, and the motivations behind this project.
If you can spare the time (1:06), it’s a good listen.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-change-log-">
<a name="what-makes-a-good-change-log-" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-a-good-change-log-"></a>
What makes a good change log?
</h3>
<p>I’m glad you asked.</p>
<p>A good change log sticks to these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.</li>
<li>Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).</li>
<li>One sub-section per version.</li>
<li>List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).</li>
<li>Write all dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. (Example: <code>2012-06-02</code> for <code>June 2nd, 2012</code>.) It’s international, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1179/">sensible</a>, and language-independent.</li>
<li>Explicitly mention whether the project follows <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>.</li>
<li>Each version should:
<ul>
<li>List its release date in the above format.</li>
<li>Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:</li>
<li><code>Added</code> for new features.</li>
<li><code>Changed</code> for changes in existing functionality.</li>
<li><code>Deprecated</code> for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.</li>
<li><code>Removed</code> for deprecated features removed in this release.</li>
<li><code>Fixed</code> for any bug fixes.</li>
<li><code>Security</code> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-can-i-minimize-the-effort-required-">
<a name="how-can-i-minimize-the-effort-required-" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-minimize-the-effort-required-"></a>
How can I minimize the effort required?
</h3>
<p>Always have an <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> section at the top for keeping track of any
changes.</p>
<p>This serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases</li>
<li>At release time, you just have to change <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> to the version number
and add a new <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> header at the top.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-makes-unicorns-cry-">
<a name="what-makes-unicorns-cry-" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-unicorns-cry-"></a>
What makes unicorns cry?
</h3>
<p>Alright…let’s get into it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dumping a diff of commit logs.</strong> Just don’t do that, you’re helping nobody.</li>
<li><strong>Not emphasizing deprecations.</strong> When people upgrade from one version to
another, it should be painfully clear when something will break.</li>
<li><strong>Dates in region-specific formats.</strong> Americans put the month first
(&quot;06-02-2012&quot; for June 2nd, 2012, which makes <em>no</em> sense), while Brits
use a robotic-looking &quot;2 June 2012&quot;, yet pronounce it differently.
&quot;2014-06-02&quot; works logically from largest to smallest, and doesn&#39;t overlap
in ambiguous ways with other date formats, and thus is the recommended
date format for change logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more. Help me collect those unicorn tears by
<a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues/new">opening an issue</a>
or a pull request.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-standard-change-log-format-">
<a name="is-there-a-standard-change-log-format-" class="anchor" href="#is-there-a-standard-change-log-format-"></a>
Is there a standard change log format?
</h3>
<p>Sadly, no. But I want to change that.</p>
<p>This project <a href="./CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become the standard CHANGELOG file</a>
for all open source projects. Take a look at it, and please suggest improvements!</p>
<h3 id="what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named-">
<a name="what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named-" class="anchor" href="#what-should-the-change-log-file-be-named-"></a>
What should the change log file be named?
</h3>
<p>Well, if you can’t tell from the example above, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is the
best convention so far.</p>
<p>Some projects also use <code>HISTORY.txt</code>, <code>HISTORY.md</code>, <code>History.md</code>, <code>NEWS.txt</code>,
<code>NEWS.md</code>, <code>News.txt</code>, <code>RELEASES.txt</code>, <code>RELEASE.md</code>, <code>releases.md</code>, etc.</p>
<p>It’s a mess. All these names only makes it harder for people to find it.</p>
<h3 id="why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff-">
<a name="why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff-" class="anchor" href="#why-can-t-people-just-use-a-code-git-log-code-diff-"></a>
Why can’t people just use a <code>git log</code> diff?
</h3>
<p>Because log diffs are full of noise. Can we really expect every single
commit in an open source project to be meaningful and self-explanatory?
That seems like a pipe dream.</p>
<h3 id="can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed-">
<a name="can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed-" class="anchor" href="#can-change-logs-be-automatically-parsed-"></a>
Can change logs be automatically parsed?
</h3>
<p>It’s difficult, because people follow wildly different formats and file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/">Vandamme</a> is a Ruby gem
created by the <a href="http://gemnasium.com">Gemnasium</a> team and which parses
many (but not all) open source project change logs.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot-">
<a name="why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot-" class="anchor" href="#why-do-you-alternate-between-spelling-it-quot-changelog-quot-and-quot-change-log-quot-"></a>
Why do you alternate between spelling it &quot;CHANGELOG&quot; and &quot;change log&quot;?
</h3>
<p>&quot;CHANGELOG&quot; is the name of the file itself. It&#39;s a bit shouty but it&#39;s a
historical convention followed by many open source project. Other
examples of similar files include <a href="README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>,
and <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p>
<p>The uppercase naming (which in old operating systems made these files stick
to the top) is used to draw attention to them. Since they&#39;re important
metadata about the project, they could be useful to anyone intending to use
or contribute to it, much like <a href="http://shields.io">open source project badges</a>.</p>
<p>When I refer to a &quot;change log&quot;, I&#39;m talking about the function of this
file: to log changes.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-yanked-releases-">
<a name="what-about-yanked-releases-" class="anchor" href="#what-about-yanked-releases-"></a>
What about yanked releases?
</h3>
<p>Yanked releases are versions that had to be pulled because of a serious
bug or security issue. Often these versions don&#39;t even appear in change
logs. They should. This is how you should display them:</p>
<p><code>## 0.0.5 - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]</code></p>
<p>The <code>[YANKED]</code> tag is loud for a reason. It&#39;s important for people to
notice it. Since it&#39;s surrounded by brackets it&#39;s also easier to parse
programmatically.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-contribute-">
<a name="how-can-i-contribute-" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-contribute-"></a>
How can I contribute?
</h3>
<p>This document is not the <strong>truth</strong>; it’s my carefully considered
opinion, along with information and examples I gathered.
Although I provide an actual <a href="./CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> on <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog">the GitHub repo</a>,
I have purposefully not created a proper <em>release</em> or clear list of rules
to follow (as <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer.org</a> does, for instance).</p>
<p>This is because I want our community to reach a consensus. I believe the
discussion is as important as the end result.</p>
<p>So please <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues"><strong>pitch in</strong></a>.</p>
